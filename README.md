Spotify Clone made for Im√£ Tech Bootcamp! A simple clone, yet elegant and interesting design. 

The site was made today (14/11/2023), between 9 a.m and 17 p.m. The task was to do a spotify clone based on this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sEUC7OQfq4. In the video, responsive design isn't utilized, so i invented(and copied a little) design, based on the current Spotify Website.
Also it was added a little Javascript code to work with the dropdown menu included. I confess i was a bit spoiled by Tailwind framework, and lost my ways with pure CSS, but it all worked fine in the end, at least i think so!

I think it is cool to say i didn't used the video a lot, and probabily my code is not super organized or effective as the person who made the video, but i believe it was important for me to train pure CSS again without copying.
