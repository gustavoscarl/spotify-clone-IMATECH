# SpotifyClone

Hello!ðŸ‘‹

This project, the Spotify clone was made for ImÃ£ Tech Bootcamp in partnership with MXM! A simple clone, yet elegant and interesting design. 

The site was made today (14/11/2023), between 9 a.m and 5 p.m. The task was to do a Spotify clone based on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sEUC7OQfq4). In the video, responsive design isn't utilized, so I invented (and copied a little) design, based on the current Spotify Website. Also, a little JavaScript code was added to work with the dropdown menu included. I confess I was a bit spoiled by the Tailwind framework and lost my way with pure CSS, but it all worked fine in the end, at least I think so!
